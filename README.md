# [BidMe](https://bidme.netlify.app/) 
BidMe is all about bids. It's a site where you can upload your staff for a real-time auction. Other users can bid a higher price anytime they want (according to a table of different minimum prices depending  on the latest price), to win the auction and get their desired product. 
As a user, you can be a Seller and Bidder, depending  on the actions you prefer to make. BUT you should be careful not to fall into greediness because we have a few rules to prevent exploitation:

1. The user can end the auction anytime he wants, so bidders will not bid for fun. 
2. You must have Credit card linked to your account in order to bid. 
3. Sellers can't bid to their own product.
4. The higher the price the higher the minimum bid price :

| Price | The minimum difference between bids |
| :----- | :---------: |
| 1-10$ |  1$  |
| 10-100$ | 10$ |
| 100-5000$ | 100$ |
| 5000-10000$ | 500$ |
| 10000-50000$ | 1000$ |
| 50000$ + | 5000$ |
